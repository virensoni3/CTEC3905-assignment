This is a website which shows pictures of supercars and also includes some information about myself.

## About the website

- This website is a single-page web application which has images and also some information in the form of text.

- The website is split up using section ids.


## Navigation/Header

- The navigation bar includes the website name which is called SUPERCARS, and also the navigation links.

- The heading called SUPERCARS is floated to the left and the navigation links are floated to the right.


## Homepage

- The homepage features an image of a car as the background and an animated arrow which the user can click on.

- The animated arrow is made using CSS which when the user clicks on, redirects to the about section.



## ABOUT ME section

- This section has some information about what I do. The background is white and the text is black.


## GALLERY section

- This section has images of four cars which are spaced evenly.

- When the user hovers over the images, text appears which shows some information about the image.

- The images are responsive and resize at 600px and 950px. The site is mobile first.


## Contact/Footer

- This section has a Sitemap and also a map which uses an API.


## User Testing - Family and friends

### Usability

- I observed the user and noticed that the website was fairly straighforward to use. The website had effective navigation and the content was easy to locate.

- The animated arrow was liked by alot of people and the the feedback was that the website was simple yet beautiful.

- When clicking on the links, there is smooth scroll using the help of CSS and this was liked as well.


### User Interface

- Moreover, the feedback was that good colour combinations were used and everything was well layed out. The background image in the homepage was really nice and went well with the rest of the website.

- The text seemed easy to read in both mobile and desktop size. Also, the font chosen was nice and went well with the theme of the website.

- No one felt that there was excessive text or that the website felt crammed which was a bonus.

- The website worked fine on a mobile phone, a tabled and on a desktop. The images and text resized well.

- Everyone liked the fact that all the information was on one page. Thus the idea of a single page web app made sense.


## Comments

- A lot of people liked the quality of the images that I used in the website.

- The way the images resized was also appreciated and went well with the black background.

- A lot of people really liked the sliding text when a user hovered on the images.


## Problems and solutions 

- Originally I had a different background image on the homepage however I had to change it because it was not big enough for a large screen desktop.

- When I was doing the animated arrow, I decided to make the arrow thicker so it was more visible.

- When I had the images of the 4 cars, I needed to decide how the pictures would be displayed on various screen resizes. Thus on a laptop or large screen the images would be displayed 2 by 2 and on a mobile it would be displayed in one column with 4 images.

- Another problem that I had is that the background image was not resizing. However I changed the background-size and background-attachment properties and that was resolved.
