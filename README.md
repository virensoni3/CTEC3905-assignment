This is a website which shows pictures of supercars and also includes some information about myself.

## About the website

- This website is a single-page web application which has images and also some information in the form of text.

- The website is split up using section ids.


## Navigation/Header

- The navigation bar includes the website name which is called SUPERCARS, and also the navigation links.

- The heading called SUPERCARS is floated to the left and the navigation links are floated to the right.


## Homepage

- The homepage features an image of a car as the background and an animated arrow which the user can click on.

- The animated arrow is made using CSS which when the user clicks on, redirects to the about section.



## ABOUT ME section

- This section has some information about what I do. The background is white and the text is black.


## GALLERY section

- This section has images of four cars which are spaced evenly.

- When the user hovers over the images, text appears which shows some information about the image.

- The images are responsive and resize at 600px and 950px. The site is mobile first.


## Contact/Footer

- This section has a Sitemap and also a map which uses an API.


## User Testing - Family and friends

### Usability

- I observed the user and noticed that the website was fairly straighforward to use. The website had effective navigation and the content was easy to locate.

- The animated arrow was liked by alot of people and the the feedback was that the website was simple yet beautiful.

- When clicking on the links, there is smooth scroll using the help of CSS and this was liked as well.


### User Interface

- Moreover, the feedback was that good colour combinations were used and everything was well layed out. The background image in the homepage was really nice.

- The text seemed easy to read in both mobile and desktop size. Also, the font chosen was nice and went well with the theme of the website.

- No one felt that there was excessive text or that the website felt crammed which was a bonus.

- The website worked fine on a mobile phone, a tabled and on a desktop. The images and text resized well.

- Everyone liked the fact that all the information was on one page. Thus the idea of a single page web app made sense.
